# Doctor Assistant AI

An AI-powered clinical assistant built with **Streamlit**, **LLaMA 3 (via Groq)**, and **vector search (RAG)**.  
This app simulates a medical assistant that suggests **medications** and **exams** based on patient data — while respecting allergies and past reactions.

## Features

- Intelligent suggestions of medications and lab exams
- Allergy and adverse reaction filtering logic
- LLM reasoning with Groq (LLaMA 3 70B)
- Vector search with FAISS + HuggingFace embeddings
- Modular architecture (strategies, services, core models)
- Interactive UI built with Streamlit



## How it Works

1. **User inputs** patient data through a simple and clean Streamlit interface.
2. The app sends the data to an **LLM hosted on Groq**, which generates medical search terms (e.g., drug classes, active ingredients).
3. These terms are used in a **vector search (RAG)** over a local database of medications.
4. Documents with **forbidden substances** (e.g., based on allergies) are **filtered out**.
5. The LLM makes a final recommendation based on the patient’s context and the safe options retrieved.

## Setup (using Poetry)

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/doctor-assistant.git
   cd doctor-assistant
   ```
2. Install the dependencies:

  ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

3. Activate the virtual enviroment:

 ```bash
   poetry shell
   ```

4. Make sure to set up your .env file with your GROQ API key

```python
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

5. Run the streamlit app:

```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
