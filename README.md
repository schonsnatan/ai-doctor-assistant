# 🤖 Doctor Assistant AI

An AI-powered clinical assistant built with **Streamlit**, **LLaMA 3 (via Groq)**, and **vector search (RAG)**.  
This app simulates a medical assistant that suggests **medications** and **exams** based on patient data — while respecting allergies and past reactions.



## 🚀 Features

- 🔎 Intelligent suggestions of medications and lab exams
- ✅ Allergy and adverse reaction filtering logic
- 🧠 LLM reasoning with Groq (LLaMA 3 70B)
- 🔍 Vector search with FAISS + HuggingFace embeddings
- 📦 Modular architecture (strategies, services, core models)
- 🖥️ Interactive UI built with Streamlit



## 🧠 How it Works

1. **User inputs** patient data through a simple and clean Streamlit interface.
2. The app sends the data to an **LLM hosted on Groq**, which generates medical search terms (e.g., drug classes, active ingredients).
3. These terms are used in a **vector search (RAG)** over a local database of medications.
4. Documents with **forbidden substances** (e.g., based on allergies) are **filtered out**.
5. The LLM makes a final recommendation based on the patient’s context and the safe options retrieved.
